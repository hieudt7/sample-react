    <p>Kelly beamed brightly. The 100 gold coins had finally been garnered and the very first challenge accomplished.</p>

    <p>From behind the boulder, a merman hurtled towards Kelly with a trident. Kla yet was one step ahead. In the blink of an eye, the skilled pirate slayed the merman’s head before he could reach the princess.</p>

    <p>Kelly frowned at the foul turquoise blood on her boots.</p>

    <p>“Kla, it’s all your fault! His blood spilled on my boots!” It was her new pirate uniforms - a shiny whale-leather pair of boots, an impeccable white linen shirt, along with a flamboyant hat embellished with feathers. </p>

    <p>As usual, Kla responded with a guileless smile</p>

    <p>“Let’s go home. Thanks for saving my life anyway. You’re my true bro,” Kelly said with a cheeky grin. </p>

    <p>Kelly couldn’t wait to tell her father - Andrew the Pirate King - about her triumph. </p>

    <p>“Well done, Kelly! You must have taught them one hell of a lesson, haven’t you?” - the pirate king cracked up while sipping on the rum.</p>

    <p>According to the Pirate’s Code, any offspring of the pirate king who accomplishes three challenges will be the rightful heir of the throne. The 3 challenges would commence as soon as they turned 16. As the Captain of notorious Bloody Mary, the King had brought down countless Royal Navy ships since the age of 15.</p>

    <p>“Your second challenge, Kelly, will be hijack the Elegante and bring it back here.” King Andrew pointed to the map - “3 days from now, it will cross Bermuda. And the captain is only a 15-year-old rascal.”</p>

    <p>“And the most prominent captain of the Royal Navy in the last 100 of years. Elegante harnesses 16 cannons on each side. It takes a little bit of finesse to bring it down.” Kla speculated. </p>

    <p>“This ship is no match for Bloody Mary,” boasted Kelly. </p>

    <p>Kelly hopped out of the room. Kla turned to King Andrew: “Your majesty, are you sure? Elegante is not an easy prey.” </p>

    <p>“Shrewd and cautious as always. That’s why I trust you to take care of my daughter. I’ve got a present for you.”</p>

    <p>King Andrew arose and handed a box to Kla. “Don’t let me down.”</p>`,
  story52: `
    <p>Hundreds of pirates flooded onto Elegante. Kelly noticed a bleach-hair royal guard fighting back valiantly with a frying pan. The Princess sprinted towards the bow to see his charming face clearer. </p>

    <p>A fireshot saved the bleach-hair guy. It was the Captain of Elegante. Her appearance alone had boosted Royal Guards’ morale remarkably. Kelly dropped down to the deck to face the two opponents.</p>
  
  `,
  story53: `
    <p>A royal guard hurtled towards Kelly only to take her roundhouse kick and fall into the sea. The Princess’ heart pounded as she got closer to Maxim’s handsome face. </p>

    <p>That handsome face immediately took a sucker punch from Kla. The bleach-hair guard could barely stand his ground and fell to the ground. Then the Captain was overwhelmed and tied down by the pirates. The remaining Royal Guards laid down their weapons soon after her capture.</p>
    
    <p>“Victory is ours!” Kla pridefully acclaimed. But Kelly seemed to have another concern.</p>
    
    <p>“We won’t kill those two, will we, Kla?” Kelly begged on the way home. Kla kept silent. He was unsure that the King would spare their lives.</p>
    
    <p>The door to the King’s room swung open. Kelly sprinted like a wind to the King’s side and grabbed his arm.</p>
    
    <p>“Father! You love me the most, don’t you? You would give me anything in the world, wouldn’t you?”</p>
    
    <p>King Andrew’s face turned solemn as if he knew his daughter’s intent. Yet he’d never let anyone in Royal Navy live. </p>
    
    <p>“Kelly, You still want to be King, don’t you?” </p>
    
    <p>“Father! The Pirate’s Code states it, I may choose my companions in the last challenge. Even the King cannot refute.”</p>
    
    <p>Kelly was right and King Andrew knew it. It was written in the Pirate’s Code. </p>
    
    <p>“Then my companions will be Kla and the captain siblings from Elegante. Please concur, father.” </p>
    
    <p>“Kelly, you are one cheeky little rascal. Rules are rules. Even the Pirate King can’t go against your wish. So be it. Those 2 Royal Guards will be your companions. Now it’s time for your final challenge. Watch!”</p>
    
    <p>The King spreaded out an old map onto the table. He pointed to a bizarre island on the Atlantic Ocean. </p>
    
    <p>“The final challenge… Retrieve the soul of Cthulhu!.”</p>

  story41: `
    <p>There once lived two siblings named Maxim & Misha, residing in a Spanish colony of the Caribbean. For their God-given talents, Maxim & Misha were recruited to the revered legion of Royal Guards at very young age. As little ones from a coastal town, they helplessly witnessed their parents murdered in cold blood by the pirates. </p><p>The two orphans swore to bring about the annihilation of all pirates on all Seven Seas. Maxim’s stolidity was only surpassed by his incredible shrewdness - he was dubbed the head of the navy ordnance. Misha excelled in piloting - she was entitled the Captain of legendary Elegante. Elegante was renowned for its formidable artillery, harnessing up to 16 cannons on each side. </p>
  `,
  story42: `
    <p>Just one day after their investiture as Royal Guards, their ship was ordered to set sail and came across a bizarre storm. Misha soon noticed and warned Maxim that they were in the notorious Bermuda - home to the most fearsome pirates in all Seven Seas.</p>
  `,
  story43: `
    <p>Misha’s ship was soon besieged by Bloody Mary, a pirate ship twice its size. Fighting back as valiantly as they did, Maxim & Misha were soon outmaneuvered by the savage pirates. Maxim passed out and lost his consciousness…</p>
